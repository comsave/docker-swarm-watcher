```

# run 

To expose an event endpoint and listen to docker service:create events

To specify specific commands for each event you can use a command file. See example-commands.yml

```bash
docker-swarm-watcher -u username -p password -s="unix:///var/run/docker.sock" -f="/home/user/commands.yml"
```
